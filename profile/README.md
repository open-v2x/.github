[OpenV2X](https://openv2x.org) is an open source project for Roadside Open Infrastructure (RSOI) in
5G/6G Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System (CVIS).

## What is OpenV2X？

OpenV2X is committed to providing an open source solution that processes the "roadside" open
infrastructure of vehicle-road collaboration through "far-edge" computing power.

In the "cloud-edge-device" three-layer architecture, OpenV2X focuses on the "far edge" (5G/6G base
station side edge cloud computing), and does not involve the "near edge" (RSU industrial computer)
part. In the "vehicle-road collaboration" framework, OpenV2X focuses on the "roadside" open
infrastructure, and does not involve the "vehicle" part.

OpenV2X provides the following capabilities:

- Roadside equipment (including RSU, lidar, millimeter-wave radar, signal lights, cameras and so on)
  management
- Roadside data collection and analysis
- Central cloud control platform information summary and display

## Why need OpenV2X?

Why do we need a "roadside collaboration" solution with the "vehicle intelligent driving" solution?

Simple analogy: The car can drive in the dark, but it is safer with street lights. OpenV2X plays the
role of "street light" in the overall solution of vehicle-road collaboration.

## OpenV2X Vision and Goals

The "Vision" of OpenV2X:

- To improve the state of transportation in real life.
- Reduce traffic jams and accidents by monitoring and analyzing roadside device data
- Facing emergencies, accelerating traffic response and rescue capabilities

The "goals" of OpenV2X:

- A large number of practical and replicable deployment cases
- Form a profitable, marketable business model (SaaS/Enterprise Edition)
- Promote the formation of a good software and hardware ecosystem in the industry, adapt to the
  southbound hardware management interface, provide a unified northbound API, and bring together
  vehicle-road collaboration algorithms
